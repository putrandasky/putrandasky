## 👋 Hi, I’m Radityo

I design **business systems** and build **web applications** based on real operational workflows.

My focus is not just on shipping features, but on creating systems that are **clear, structured, and maintainable** as rules, data, and usage grow.

I work best on problems where processes are still manual, fragmented, or spreadsheet-driven — and need to be turned into reliable systems.

## 🧩 How I Work

* Prefer simple, boring solutions that scale operationally
